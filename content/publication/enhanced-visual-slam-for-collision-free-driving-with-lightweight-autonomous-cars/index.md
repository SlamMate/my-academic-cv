abstract: "The paper presents a vision-based obstacle avoidance strategy for
  lightweight self-driving cars that can be run on a CPU-only device using a
  single RGB-D camera. The method consists of two steps: visual perception and
  path planning. The visual perception part uses ORBSLAM3 enhanced with optical
  flow to estimate the carâ€™s poses and extract rich texture information from the
  scene. In the path planning phase, the proposed method employs a method
  combining a control Lyapunov function and control barrier function in the form
  of a quadratic program (CLF-CBF-QP) together with an obstacle shape
  reconstruction process (SRP) to plan safe and stable trajectories. To validate
  the performance and robustness of the proposed method, simulation experiments
  were conducted with a car in various complex indoor environments using the
  Gazebo simulation environment. The proposed method can effectively avoid
  obstacles in the scenes. The proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark
  algorithms in achieving more stable and shorter trajectories across multiple
  simulated scenes."
