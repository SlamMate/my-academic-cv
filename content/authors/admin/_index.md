Qi Zhang is a Msc student of data science at the University Of Glasgow. His research interests include visual SLAM in dynamic environment, deep learning and multi object tracking(MOT). He is currently completing his MSc final year project on the optimisation of monocular vSLAM in dynamic environments under the supervision of Prof. Paul Sieber at the University of Glasgow. Meanwhile, he is collaborating with Dr Zhihao Lin (PhD candidate) and Dr Jianglin Lan (Lecturer) at the University of Glasgow to solve the scene reconstruction problem of vSLAM in dynamic environments. He has collaborated with Dr Changdi Li of Zhejiang University to solve the semantic SLAM problem in dynamic environments, and published as the first author in MST (Measurement Science and Technology, JCR:Q1).
