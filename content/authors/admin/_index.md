Qi Zhang is an MSc student of data science at the University of Glasgow, with research interests in visual SLAM, deep learning, and multi-object tracking. He is currently working on optimizing monocular vSLAM in dynamic environments for his final year project under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Siebert](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/paulsiebert/), alongside collaborating on scene reconstruction and Robot control in dynamic environments with Dr. Zhihao Lin under the supervision of [Dr. Jianglin Lan](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/jianglinlan/). He has previously worked with Dr. Changdi Li of Zhejiang University on solving semantic SLAM problems in dynamic environments and has published as the first author in MST(JCR:q1). Outside of his research work, he leads a colourful life as an amateur electronic music producer (signed by NetEase.com) and an amateur long-distance runner (10km/40min).
