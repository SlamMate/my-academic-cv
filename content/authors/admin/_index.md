Zhang Qi is a first-year PhD student in the computer vision group at UvA, researching the optimization of the tracking module for Monocular Gaussian SLAM under the joint supervision of [Dr. Martin R. Oswald](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=biytQP8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Sezer Karaoglu](https://karaoglusezer.github.io/), and [Prof. Theo Gevers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yqsvxQgAAAAJ&hl=en). Occasionally, I do interesting things with [Prof. Arnoud](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.visser/) about real-world robots.

During the master's studies at the University of Glasgow, he is working on optimizing monocular vSLAM in dynamic environments for his final year project under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Siebert](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/paulsiebert/), alongside collaborating on the Camera-Assisted Algorithm for Autonomous Exploration Aiding the Visually Impaired in dynamic environments with Dr. Zhihao Lin and Dr. Zhen Tian under the supervision of [Dr. Jianglin Lan](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/jianglinlan/)in Glasgow. Outside his research work, he is an outstanding beatbox performer and an amateur long-distance runner (10km/40min).
