title: See u in ICRA@40
abstract: >-
  The ICRA conference is celebrating its 40 anniversary in Rotterdam in
  September 2024, with as highlight the Happy Birthday ICRA Party at the iconic
  Holland America Line Cruise Terminal. One month later the IROS conference will
  take place, which will include the Earth Rover Challenge. In this challenge
  open-world autonomous navigation models are studied truly open-world settings.


  As part of the Earth Rover Challenge several real-world navigation sets in several cities world-wide, like Auckland, Australia and Wuhan, China. The only dataset recorded in the Netherlands is the small village Oudewater. The proposal is to record a dataset with the robot used in the Earth Rover Challenge in Rotterdam, in front of the Holland America Line Cruise Terminal, before the festivities of the Happy Birthday ICRA Party start.
